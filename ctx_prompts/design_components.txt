# Engineering Components

## Backend Server
- **Local Web Server**: Utilizes frameworks like Flask (Python) or Express.js (Node.js) to run a local server.
- **Request Handler**: Module to process incoming HTTP requests, parsing paths, headers, and data.
- **API Integration Service**: Handles the construction, sending, and receiving of requests to external large language model APIs, including authentication and error handling.
- **Filesystem Service**: Provides functionalities for reading from and writing to the local filesystem, including file manipulation and directory traversal.
- **Response Service**: Formats and sends responses to the frontend, including AI responses and file data.

## Frontend Application
- **UI Components**: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks like React or Vue.js for dynamic content rendering.
- **API Client**: JavaScript module for sending and receiving HTTP requests to/from the backend server.
- **File Management Interface**: Allows users to upload and download files, and view local files available for processing.
- **Settings and Configuration**: Interface for inputting and storing API keys and other configuration settings, possibly using local storage or passed to the backend for secure storage.

## API Integration
- **Key Management**: Secure storage and retrieval mechanism for API keys, possibly using environment variables or encrypted storage solutions.
- **Request Formatter**: Constructs requests to fit the API specifications of the large language models, including query parameters and body formatting.
- **Response Processor**: Parses and formats the responses from the AI APIs for presentation in the frontend UI.

## Filesystem Interaction
- **File Browser**: Allows users to navigate their local filesystem through the UI, implemented via calls to the backend for directory contents.
- **Upload/Download Manager**: Handles file uploads from the user to the backend for processing, and downloads of processed files or results back to the user.
