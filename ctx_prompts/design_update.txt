I would like to update the design doc based on the following:

I would like to add the ability to have 'user sessions' each user session should create a folder in the local file system to contain files created or downloaded during that session. The contents of the folder will be displayed in the UI. The user can load a session by submitting a session name in the UI. The top level folder that contains the session files should match in name to the user submitted name. 

Can you rewrite the entire design to incorporate the necessary changes. The new version should incorporates the additional functionality for user sessions without altering the original design's intent or structure.
