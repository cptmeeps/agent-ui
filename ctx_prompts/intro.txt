I am building an ai agent ui application. 

Right now I am in the prototype phase so I will be doing all my development locally.

I would like to use a flask server to serve as a mock backend. And I will be returning html, css and plain javascript files. Their will only be a single page (index.html) so no complicated routing is needed. 

I want the locally run flask app to access the local file system.
