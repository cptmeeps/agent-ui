## Technical Specifications

### Programming Languages and Frameworks
- **Backend Server**: Python with Flask. Flask is chosen for its simplicity and suitability for prototyping a local web server.
- **Frontend Application**: JavaScript with React. React is selected for its component-based architecture, facilitating the development of a dynamic and responsive UI.

### Protocols and Data Formats
- **HTTP/HTTPS**: For communication between the frontend and backend. HTTPS for secure data transmission if deploying publicly in the future.
- **JSON**: Standard data format for sending and receiving API requests and responses, and for frontend-backend communication.

### External API Integration
- **RESTful APIs**: Interaction with large language model APIs using REST principles.
- **OAuth 2.0**: For secure API authentication where necessary.

### Filesystem Access
- **Local Filesystem API**: Backend uses Python's built-in `os` and `shutil` libraries for filesystem operations.

### Development Tools
- **Version Control**: Git, for source code management.
- **IDEs**: Visual Studio Code or PyCharm for backend (Python), and Visual Studio Code for frontend (JavaScript/React).

### Testing Frameworks
- **Backend Testing**: pytest, for testing Flask applications.
- **Frontend Testing**: Jest, alongside React Testing Library, for unit and integration tests.

### Deployment
- **Local Deployment**: The application is designed to run locally during the prototyping phase, with potential for containerization (using Docker) for ease of setup and consistency across development environments.
